# Shell Tools 🐚🖥️🤖

This is a repository for old and untested Shell Scripting snippets.

> **Warning**: Caution is advised since some of those tools can modify your system.

Some of the scripts in this repository require a modern version of Bash Shell to run (v4.4+), mainly because of `mapfile -t` `builtin` usage for arrays.

The systems administration tools are designed to work on modern GNU/Linux or MacOS.
